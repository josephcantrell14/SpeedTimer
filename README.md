# SpeedTimer
A free, speedy, and open source timer application made using Godot Engine 3.4.  Open this software using Godot Engine.  The only missing asset is the font I used for my build. Modify and redistribute this software however you want.  Even though it's unlicensed, please support my indie efforts to make awesome stuff and buy some of my video games.  

Windows and Linux builds are on itch.io: https://josephcantrell14.itch.io/speed-timer

An HTML5 version is on my website: https://josephcantrell.org/programs/speed-timer/Speed%20Timer.html
